The magic elevator's buttons are special. The magic elevator has buttons with integers of the form 10c (integers where c â‰¥ 0), such as -1, +1, -10, +10, -100, +100, and so on. When you press the button on the magic elevator, you move to the floor that is the current floor number plus the value written on the button. However, if the result of adding the value of the floor where the elevator is located and the button is less than 0, the elevator does not move. In Minsu's world, floor 0 is the lowest floor, and the elevator is currently on Minsu's floor.

To move the magic elevator, you will use one magic stone per button. For example, if Minsu on the 16th floor wants to go to floor 0, press the button with -1 6 times and the button with -10 1. Press once to consume 7 magic stones to go to floor 0. However, if you press the button with +1 4 times and the button with -10 2 times, you can consume 6 magic stones to go to floor 0.
To save the magic stone, Minsu always tries to move by pressing the least number of buttons. I would like to know the minimum number of magic stones Minsu needs to take the elevator down to floor 0 from any floor. Complete the solution function to return the minimum number of magic stones needed to get to floor 0, given Minsu and an integer storey representing the floor the magic elevator is on.
